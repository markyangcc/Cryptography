# Cryptography
Cryptography Repository to host self-implemented cipher algorithms


## Affine Cipher
Affine Cipher implementation using C++

#### How to run?
```cpp
make && ./main
```

## Big Data Primality Test

Fermat Test to test a big number if it's a prime number with `Miracl` Library in C++.

## Caesar Cipher
Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as
En ( x ) = ( x + n ) mod 26


## Chinese Remainder Theorem

Use Chinese Remainder Theorem Algorithm to Solve Congruence Equations(big number) with `Miracl` Library in C.

## Diffie Hellman Algorithm
Diffie Hellman Algorithm implementation using with c

## ElGamal

## Hill Cipher

Hill Cioher encrypt and decrypt with Eigen Library.

You can download the library from gitlab and follow the link——[Eigen 3.3.8.zip](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.3.8/eigen-3.3.8.zip)

After extrat the zip, just copy the Eigen folder in the eigen-3.3.8 folder into your project place to test the program.
