# Cryptography
Cryptography Repository to host self-implemented cipher algorithms



## Big Data Primality Test

Fermat Test to test a big number if it's a prime number with `Miracl` Library in C++.



## Chinese Remainder Theorem

Use Chinese Remainder Theorem Algorithm to Solve Congruence Equations(big number) with `Miracl` Library in C.



## LZW Compress

The OpenSource LZW Compress algorithm self-implementation in C++.

The officeal source code can be found on the offical website of LEW Compress.



## Playfair Encryption

Cryptography algorithm——Playfair Encryption, implemented with C++ STL Library.



## Hill Cipher

Hill Cioher encrypt and decrypt with Eigen Library.

You can download the library from gitlab and follow the link——[Eigen 3.3.8.zip](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.3.8/eigen-3.3.8.zip)

After extrat the zip, just copy the Eigen folder in the eigen-3.3.8 folder into your project place to test the program.
